Repository Name: wacky-flip-game

🎮 About the Game
Wacky Flip is a fast-paced, physics-driven mobile and desktop game where chaos is not a bug—it's a feature! Players control wacky characters who flip, flop, bounce, and fly through wildly unpredictable obstacle courses filled with springboards, traps, and hilarious hazards.

Designed for fun, replayability, and ridiculous mid-air moments, Wacky Flip combines cartoon-style art with dynamic ragdoll physics to deliver a hilarious stunt experience for all ages.

🚀 Features
- 🌀 Flipping Physics: Real-time ragdoll physics for unexpected movements and epic fails

- 🎯 Challenging Courses: Jump, dive, and roll through increasingly absurd levels

- 💥 Obstacles Galore: From giant fans to exploding crates—every level is a surprise

- 🎨 Colorful Art Style: Bright, bold environments and quirky character designs

- 🔊 Original Soundtrack: Upbeat, energetic music to match the game's chaotic vibe
